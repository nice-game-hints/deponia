There is an interesting elevator right to the Concourse.

# It is locked
The door to the elevator is controlled from the input Controls. Did you try it?

# Wrong password
Yeah, who would set the password for the elevator to be RUFUS?

# Rufus?
Well, yeah, but he didn't set the password, obviously.

# What is the password?
Maybe it is written somewhere. [Like in the dirty mosaic?](040-do-mosaic.md)

# Integesting
You didn't get the password but you found something more interesting!

# Torch Light!
Something more interesting. Behind it.

# Fuse Switch
You can reboot the elevator and set a new password. Something original...

# RUFUS!
Go type it and you have the elevator open.
