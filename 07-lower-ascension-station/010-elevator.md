There is an interesting elevator right to the Concourse.

# The elevator is locked
The door to the elevator is controlled from the input Controls. Did you try it?

# I type the wrong password
Yeah, who would set the password for the elevator to be RUFUS?

# Rufus?
Well, yeah, but he didn't set the password, obviously.

# What is the password to the elevator control?
Maybe it is written somewhere. Look around.

## Where to look for the password?
[Look in the dirty mosaic.](040-do-mosaic/index.md)

# I fixed the mosaic
You didn't get the password but you found something more interesting!

# You mean the torch light?
No, something more interesting. Behind the torch light.

## There is a fuse switch
You can reboot the elevator and set a new password. Use something original...

# RUFUS!
Fine. Go type that password and you have the elevator open.
