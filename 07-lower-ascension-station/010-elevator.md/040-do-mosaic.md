What is it with the dirty right side mosaic? Can you get some sense to it?

# It is dirty
[Clean the mosaic](050-clean-mosaic.md)

# It is clean
There is something scribbled in it. It is just so dark.

# More light
Is there any substance around that could give more light? Something phosphorous?

# Phosphorous?
The cotton candy machine produces phosphor cotton candy. [Get phosphor cotton candy.](060-cotton-candy.md)

# I have the candy!
Show the candy to the lamp and it glows! You can use it to light up the mosaic.

# No?
Stick the cotton candy into the Hatch on the mosaic.

# It is missing a piece
There was a mosaic piece laying around on the floor of the Concourse. Try it to the hole.

# It won't stick
Maybe you could somehow stick it there. With something sweet.

# Like?
Like a chewing gum?

# Chewing gum
There is a chewing gum machine at the Candy Store.

# Chewy
Chew the chewing gum and stick it on the mosaic piece. Use the mosaic piece to the mosaic.

# Pieces!
