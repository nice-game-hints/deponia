What is it with the dirty right side mosaic? Can you get some sense to it?

# The mosaic is dirty
[Clean the mosaic](050-clean-mosaic.md), first.

# The mosaic is clean now
There is something scribbled in it. It is just so dark that you can't see it.

# Where to get more light?
Is there any substance around that could give more light? Something phosphorous?

## Tell me what light source should I use
The cotton candy machine produces [phosphor cotton candy](../060-cotton-candy.md).

# I have the cotton candy!
Show the candy to the lamp and it glows! You can use it to light up the mosaic. ^[ Stick the cotton candy into the Hatch on the mosaic. ]

## I got the mosaic lit but it is missing a piece
There was a mosaic piece laying around on the floor of the Concourse. Try it to the hole.

# The piece won't stick
Maybe you could somehow stick it there. With something sweet and _sticky_.

# What is sticky?
Like a chewing gum? ^[ There is a chewing gum machine at the Candy Store. ]

## I have a chewing gum
Chew the chewing gum and stick it on the mosaic piece. Use the mosaic piece to the mosaic.

# Pieces!
