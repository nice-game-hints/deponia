The Cotton Candy machine is interesting. One cotton candy, please.

# It's not that easy
The lever does nothing. Is the cotton candy machine shut down?

# It seems so
Maybe there is a plug somewhere. ^[ Check the self. ]

# Found the plug and plugged it in
The machine is running now.

# How to get the candy from the running machine?
You should use some kind of stick.

## Where do I get a stick?
I think they serve anchovies on a stick. Grab one from the Anchovies machine. ^[ and eat the anchovy (right click in the inventory) ]

# Cotton candy flavors
You can change the flavor by pulling the lever. Put the stick, without the anchovies, into the machine and you have some cotton candy.

## What flawor do you recommend?
I can recommend the phosphor cotton candy.
