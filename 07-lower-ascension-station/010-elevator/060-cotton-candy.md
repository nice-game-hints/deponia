The Cotton Candy machine is interesting. One Cotton Candy, please.

# It's not that easy
The lever does nothing. Is the machine shut down?

# It is
Maybe there is the plug somewhere. Check the self.

# Plugged in
The machine is running.

# How to get the candy
You should use some kind of stick.

# Stick?
I think they serve anchovies on a stick. Grab one from the Anchovies machine and eat the anchovy (right click in the inventory).

# Flavours
You can change the flavour by pulling the lever. Stick the stick into the machine and you have some cotton candy. I can recommend the phosphor cotton candy.
