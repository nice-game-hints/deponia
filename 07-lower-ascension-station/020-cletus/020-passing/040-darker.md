You should make it darker to get pass Argus.

# The lamp
Yes, shut the lamp off

# How?
Maybe you could break it somehow. Look at the floor.

# Pebble!
Yes, take a pebble and stone it!

# I need a weapon
What weapon could it be? Use your engineering skills!

# Weapon
Kids use slingshots to fire pebbles.

# Slingshot
There is an Embellishment on the top platform railing. That looks like a slingshot-ey piece.

# The sling
You need something elastic to complete the slingshot.

# Elastic
You chewed something elastic earlier.

# Chewing
Pick the chewing gum under the mosaic and combine it with the y-shaped piece. You have a slingshot.

# Use it
Combine the pebble with the slingshot and shoot the lamp off.
