You should make it darker to get pass Argus.

# The lamp is giving the light
Yes, shut down the lamp

# How do I shut the lamp off?
Maybe you could break it somehow. Look at the floor. ^[ There is a pebble on the floor. ]

# I need a weapon to shoow the lamp
What weapon could be used to shoot pebbles? Use your engineering skills!

# What weapon to use?
Kids use slingshots to fire pebbles.

## How do I make a slingshot?
There is an Embellishment on the top platform railing. That looks like a slingshot-ey piece.

# I need a sling
You need something _elastic_ to complete the slingshot.

# What is elastic enough for the slingshot sling?
You _chewed_ something elastic earlier.

## Tell me what to use for the slingshot
Pick the chewing gum under the mosaic and combine it with the y-shaped piece. You have a slingshot.

# What next?
Combine the pebble, from the ground, with the slingshot and shoot the lamp off.
