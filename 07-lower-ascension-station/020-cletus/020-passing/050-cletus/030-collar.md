Cletys also has that really stiff collar. Who does he think he is?

# Collar
What thing looks like a collar if you tilt it upside down?

# A lampshade!
[Have you dropped it while making it dark?](/07-lower-ascension-station/020-cletus/020-passing/040-darker.md)

# Yes
But Argus will spot you and your costume is not yet ready.

# How to get it?
Maybe you could use some kind of extension to keep out of his sight.

# Extension
Combine the Mop Handle and the Embellishment to create a Hook. Use the Hook on the lampshade.

# And then?
Combine the with with the [Greasy Hairdo](020-hairdo.md) and [Ugly Cape](020-cape.md) to finish the costume.
