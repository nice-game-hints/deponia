Cletus also has that really stiff collar. Who does he think he is?

# Where to start?
What thing looks like a collar if you tilt it upside down? You have to do something else, first.

## Tell me what to do
[Make it darker](../040-darker.md), first.

# It is dark
The lamp dropped something.

# The lampshade, can't get it
But Argus will spot you and your costume is not yet ready.

# How to get the lampshade?
Maybe you could use some kind of _extension_ to keep out of his sight.

## Tell me what extension should I use
Combine the Mop Handle and the Embellishment to create a Hook. Use the Hook on the lampshade.

# What next?
Combine the lampshade collar with with the [greasy hairdo](010-hairdo.md) and [the ugly cape](020-cape.md) to finish the costume.
