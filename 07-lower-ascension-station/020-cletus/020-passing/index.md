You cannot pass Argus, the Organon.

# Argus sees me
It is too bright in there. [Could you make it darker?](040-darker.md)

# I got it darker
But not dark enough to sneak past Argus. But maybe dark enough to _fool him_!

# How do I fool Argus?
If you could fool Argus that you are Cletus. It shouldn't be hard as you look pretty much alike. [Impersonate Cletus.](050-cletus/index.md)

# I look like Cletus now
While wearing the Cletus Costume you can try to pass the guard.

# Argus demands a cartridge
Ohh.. how hard can it be? You would need to present a cartridge to Argus.

# Where is the cartridge?
Have you talked to Cletus again?

## What should I talk with him about?
Ask about the agreement, ask about Goal and talk trash about Deponia. Now you should be able to ask about the backup cartridge. Say that Goal is unconsciouness. You should now have the Backup Cartridge.

# I have the backup cartridge
Try to pass the guard again.

# Success!
Great job! [Go find Goal.](../030-find-goal/index.md)
