You are blocked by a heap of trash. Outside is the hungry whale.

# Whale?
Maybe the *hungry* whale would help you?

# Illogical!
It is. But trust me. Use the *hungry* whale.

# Food
What would the whale like to eat?

# Seafood?
Got get an anchovy on a stick! From the Candy Store.

# I have it
Did you try to show it to the whale?

# Yes
It doesn't see it. Maybe you could get the anchovy to glow a little more.

# Oh my god!
I know. Roll the anchovy in the Puddle of Phosphor at the Candy Store and make it glow!

# Let there be light!
Use the Torch Light to the Bait (Phosphor Anchovies) and show it to the Whale. Stupid animal...
