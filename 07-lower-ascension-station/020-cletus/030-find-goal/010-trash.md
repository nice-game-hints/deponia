You are blocked by a heap of trash. Outside is the hungry whale.

# What's with the whale?
Maybe the *hungry* whale would help you?

# That is illogical!
It is. But trust me. Use the *hungry* whale.

# What food should I give to the whale?
What would the whale like to eat?

## Whales eat seafood?
Got get an anchovy on a stick! From the Candy Store.

# I have an anchovy on a stick
Did you try to show it to the whale?

# Yes
It doesn't see it. Maybe you could get the anchovy to _glow_ a little more.

## Tell me what to do with the anchovy
Roll the anchovy in the Puddle of Phosphor at the Candy Store and make it glow!

# The anchovy stick is glowing
Use the torch light to the bait (Phosphor Anchovies) and show it to the Whale. Stupid animal...
