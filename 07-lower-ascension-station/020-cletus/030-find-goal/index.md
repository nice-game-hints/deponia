Goal is Gone! Who or what has taken her? And the Candy Store is a mess!

# Where to start?
All the phosphor spilled everywhere. What a waste.

## What to do?
Look at the Puddle of Phosphor.

# The phosphor is glowing
Yes, the lamps will make the phosphor glow. It looks like the phosphor is leaving a trail.

## What should I do?
Follow the phosphor trail!

## But the phosphor trail doesn't glow
You need to use the torch light to the puddle of phosphor.

# I can see the trail!
Follow the glowing trail. Point the light again and again to the Trace to find your way to the Grating (through the Piece of Fence).

# How to get pass the grating?
Can you jam the grating up with something?

## What should I use to jam the grating?
Use the hook to the grating. [Get past the trash heap](010-trash.md)

# I'm in!
Welcome to the boat!
