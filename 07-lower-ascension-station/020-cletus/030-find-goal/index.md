Goal is Gone! Who or what has taken her? And the Candy Store is a mess!

# Messy
Look at the Puddle of Phosphor.

# Glowing
Yes, the lamps will make the phosphor glow. It looks like the phosphor is leaving a trail.

# Follow it!
Follow the phosphor trail!

# But it doesn't glow
You need to use the Torch Light to the puddle of phosphor.

# Trail!
Follow the glowing trail. Point the light again and again to the Trace to find your way to the Grating (through the Piece of Fence).

# How to get pass?
Can you jam the grating up with something?

# Like?
Use the hook to the grating.

# Trash

# I'm in!
Welcome to the boat!
