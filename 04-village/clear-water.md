# Who has it?
In Deponia, only the rich and powerful have clear water.

# Like?
Like mayors! [How to get to mayor's office][mayor]

# Im in!
Finally! Any signs of clear water? Or any water?

# Water symbol
There is a water symbol in the desk. Your father used to have this office. Something else also belonged to your father.

# The thing!
Yes, the divining rod! Wenzel left it to his basement.

# Secrets
Use the divining rod to the water symbol and behold, a secret compartment!

# What else?
More secrets if you just find them. Use your globe.. I mean head!

# The globe?
There is a secret compartment in the globe, too. How neat. And you get a glass!

# And a keyhole!
Yes, use the key you got from the first secret compartment to the keyhole in the second secret compartment to
open the third secret compartment (huh!).

# Booze!
Have a drink! You deserve it. Don't be a barbarian, use a glass.

# A glass
Pour the booze into the glass.
