In Deponia, only the rich and powerful have clear water.

## Like, who?
Like mayors! [Get into the Mayor's office.](mayors-office/index.md)

# Im in the Mayor's office!
Finally! Any signs of clear water? Or any water?

## Tell me
There is a water symbol in the desk. Your father used to have this office. Some other thing else also belonged to your father.

## What thing?
The divining rod! Wenzel left it to his basement. This must work as _a key_.

## What to do with the rod?
Use the divining rod to the water symbol in the Mayor's office and behold, a secret compartment!

# What else should I do?
There are more secrets if you just find them. Use your _globe_.. I mean head!

## My globe?
There is a secret compartment in the globe, too. How neat. And you get a glass!

## What about the keyhole?
Yes, use the key you got from the first secret compartment to the keyhole in the second secret compartment to
open the third secret compartment (huh!).

# Booze!
Have a drink! You deserve it. Don't be a barbarian, use a glass.

# A glass?
Pour the booze into the glass.
