# Ingredients
 * [Hot beans](hot-beans.md)
 * [Black powder](black-powder.md)

# I have them
Nice, you would have to mix them somehow.

# Mixing a coffee powder?
Yes, or as we baristas call it: _grinding_.

# Grinding?
You need a grinder. Have you checked Toni's shop?

# Of course!
Go to Toni's store, open the grinder box, insert the ingredients and pull the lever.
You now have some coffee powder!
