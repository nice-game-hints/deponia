# Goal does not wake up
Did you talk to Gizmo? He is next to Goal in the Town Hall

# Yes
He mentioned something to wake her up. Really strong coffee ought to do it!

# Coffee, where?
Hmm.. Toni's coffee machine is broken. Can you find a bar somewhere?
There is Lonzo's bar in the Alley.

# Lonzo's
Talk to Lonzo until he comes up with the idea of brewing the espresso.
You get the receipt for the coffee ingredients from him.
