The handcuffs are hanging, symbolocically, there in Police Gizmo's ^[ Turn the lever in the middle position. ] office, on some kind of scale.

# Any notes?
The fire extinguisher seems to be ready to drop into the scale when it is up. Except it is too big. It doesn't fit out.

# Any more hints?
Replace the fire extinguisher with something more _round_ to tilt the scale.
^[ Remove the fire extinguisher from the Fire Fighter's Cabinet (Firefighter mode). ]

## Tell me how
Remove the fire extinguisher from the Fire Fighter's Cabinet (Firefighter mode).
Take the foot fetters out of the Police Box (Police mode) and put them into the Fire Fighter's Cabinet (Firefighter mode).
You have to pull and push the lever number of times to do this mentally challenging switch.
When you succeed, the foot fetters bump the handcuffs to you.

# Strike!
Take the handcuffs
