# Hints?
Talk to Lonzo. Well, he directs you to Hannek.

# Hannek
He hints you about the batteries they find from the trash. A battery contains "energy juice".

# Battery, but my pod...
Yes, your pod is gone. What else have batteries?

# I dunno
I think there was a car wreck at the Front Gate. The battery is usually under the hood.

# It's locked
You should open it from the inside.

# The door is locked
Why does it have to be so hard, always. Use the lock pick!

# Thanks...
Okay, it didn't work. Lousy lock pick. Who would have the key for this trash?

# Who got it here?
Probably Hannek, as he collects all kind of trash.

# Hannek, again
Talk to Hannek about the trash. He mentions the car keys. Luckily he is bad with names.

# Didn't guess
Maybe you shouldn't try to guess the name (especially only using your friends). Try to know it.

# I don't know it
Maybe it is written to the car. Like, behind the dirty windshield?

# It's so dirty
Well, clean it up. Use a sponge and some water with cleaning chemicals in it.

# Sponge...
Isn't sponge something you could find in a bathroom? Or in a kitchen? Or a combination of those?

# I know!
There is a sponge at Wenzel's bathroom/kitchen, upstairs.

# It's too dry
Well, as I said, you need water... and detergent

# Detergent!
Go on...

# To Toni's house!
Good on you! Wet the sponge at the pot on Toni's Oven. (Those are some heavy notes still burning there)

# Cleaning
Clean the windshield and read the (stupid) name of the car's owner.

# Off to Hannek
Go get your key.

# The questions
Really? You must be kidding me? Okay okay... Sugarpuff, Pink, Ballet, cheez...
