# Hints?
Talk to Lonzo (At the Alley). Well, he directs you to Hannek.

# Hannek
He hints you about the batteries they find from the trash. A battery contains "energy juice".

# Battery, but my pod...
Yes, your pod is gone. What else have batteries?

# I dunno
I think there was a car wreck at the Front Gate. The battery is usually under the hood.

# It's locked
You should open it from the inside.

# The door is locked
Why does it have to be so hard, always. Use the lock pick!

# Thanks...
Okay, it didn't work, my bad. Lousy lock pick. [How to get into the car](/04-village/energy-rich/key-inside.md)
Open the car door with the key.

# Pop!
There's the battery! After the lever, you pulled it, right?

# It's stuck
Well, you don't need the whole battery. Just the energy juice.

# Get it out
Any tool come to mind? [Get the drill](/04-village/drill.md) and drill the battery open.

# Energy juice!
Great! Where would you catch it, though? Some kind of glass would be nice.

# Mix
Catch the acid to the glass filled with water (from the liquor bottle).
