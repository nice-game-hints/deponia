One ingredient for the awakening coffee is Energy-Rich Water.

# Hints?
Talk to Lonzo (At the Alley). Well, he directs you to Hannek.

# Hannek
He hints you about the batteries they find from the trash. A battery contains "energy juice".

# Battery, but my pod...
Yes, your pod is gone. What else have batteries?

## Tell me!
I think there was a car wreck at the Front Gate. The battery is usually under the hood.

# The car at the front is locked
Why does it have to be so hard, always. Use the lock pick!

# Thanks...
Okay, it didn't work, my bad. Lousy lock pick. [Try to find keys into the car.](key-inside.md)

# I have the car key
Open the car door with the key. ^[ You have to pull the lever to open the hood. ]

# Pop! says the hood
There's the battery!

# It's stuck
Well, you don't need the whole battery. Just the energy juice.

## How to get the juice?
[Get a drill](../drill.md) and drill the battery open.

# Where to get the juice?
Some kind of glass would be nice. Look for the other ingredients.

## Tell me how to get a glass
[Get come clear water.](../clear-water.md)

# Mix
Catch the acid to the glass filled with water (from the liquor bottle).
