# Who has it?
Who would have the key for this trash?

# Who got it here?
Probably Hannek, as he collects all kind of trash.

# Hannek, again
Talk to Hannek about the trash. He mentions the car keys. Luckily he is bad with names.

# Didn't guess
Maybe you shouldn't try to guess the name (especially only using your friends). Try to know it.

# I don't know it
Maybe it is written to the car. Like, behind the dirty windshield?

# It's so dirty
Well, clean it up. Use a sponge and some water with cleaning chemicals in it.

# Sponge...
Isn't sponge something you could find in a bathroom? Or in a kitchen? Or a combination of those?

# I know!
There is a sponge at Wenzel's bathroom/kitchen, upstairs.

# It's too dry
Well, as I said, you need water... and detergent

# Detergent!
Go on...

# To Toni's house!
Good on you! Wet the sponge at the pot on Toni's Oven. (Those are some heavy notes still burning there)

# Cleaning
Clean the windshield and read the (stupid) name of the car's owner.

# Off to Hannek
Go get your key.

# The questions
Really? Are you serious? Okay okay... Sugarpuff, Pink, Ballet, cheez...
