There is a lock pick in Police Gizmo's ^[ Turn the lever in the middle position. ] office.

# The lock pick is inside the cell!
Getting through the cell grating without a key (or a lock pick) is impossible.
Is there any other way into the cell?

## What other way?
Wouldn't it be nice to have the firefighter pole ([Firefighter mode](# "Lever bottom position")) present also in the cell mode?

# But how to keep the pole while switching modes?
Notice what happens when you change the mode between Firefighter mode and other modes.

## What?
The floor opens with the pole, and _a hatch comes out at the right_. See?

# What to do to the hatch?
You should tie that hatch to something to prevent it from closing. It will control the pole.

## Prevent the pole hatch with what, exactly?
You could use the [handcuffs](../handcuffs.md) that hang, symbolocically, on some kind of scale. (Police mode)

# I have the handcuffs
Switch the office to firefighter mode and tie the pole hatch on the right to the pole with the handcuffs.

# And then?
Switch to the police mode.

# The pole stays there!
Correct!

## Where does it go?
Go to the Front of Town Gate to climb up the pole into the cell.
