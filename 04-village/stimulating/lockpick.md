# It is in the cell!
Getting through the cell grating without a key (or a lock pick) is impossible.
Hmm.. but the lock pick is inside the cell. Is there any other way into the cell?

# From the bottom?
Yes, wouldn't it be nice to have the firefighter pole (Firefighter mode) present also in the cell mode?

# But how?
The floor opens and a hatch comes out at the right. Could you jam it somehow?

# With what, exactly?
You could use the handcuffs that hang, symbolocically, on some kind of scale. (Police mode)

# Tilt the scale
There seems to be a fire extinguisher ready to drop into the scale. Except it is too big.

# Something else
Remove the fire extinguisher from the Fire Fighter's Cabinet (Firefighter mode) and replace it with
something more _round_.

# Something round?
Take the foot fetters out of the Police Box (Police mode) and put them into the Fire Fighter's Cabinet (Firefighter mode).
You have to pull and push the lever number of times to do this mentally challening switch.

# Strike!
Switch to the firefighter mode and tie the hatch to the pole with the handcuffs.

# And?
Switch to the police mode.

# The pole stays there!
Correct! Go to the Front of Town Gate to climb up the pole.
