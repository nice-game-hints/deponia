One ingredient for the awakening coffee is Extraordinary Stimulating.

## What is that?
Talk to Lonzo.

# Okay, tell me more
There should be some stimulant and syringe at Doctor Gizmo's office.

## What to do there?
Turn the lever all the way up, again.

# Can't see the stimulant nor syringe
Maybe they are behind locks.

## What locks?
They are in the Doctor's Cabinet. But it is locked! Mistrust everywhere!

# How do I open the Doctor's Cabinet?
You won't probably get the key to the cabinet from Gizmo. Maybe you could access it in _illegal_ ways?

## What illegal ways do you mean?
There is a [lock pick](lockpick.md) in Police Gizmo's ^[ Turn the lever in the middle position. ] office.

# I have the lock pick!
Change to Doctor's office mode ^[ Lever up ] and pick the lock of the Doctor's Cabinet with the lock pick.
