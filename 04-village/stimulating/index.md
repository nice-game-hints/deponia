# What is this?
Talk to Lonzo.

# Okay
There should be some stimulant and syringe at Doctor Gizmo's office. Turn the lever all the way up, again.

# Can't see it
Maybe they are behind locks.

# Maybe
They are in the Doctor's Cabinet. But it is locked! Mistrust everywhere!

# How do I open it?
You won't probably get the key from Gizmo. Maybe you could access it in _illegal_ ways?

# Illegal?
Yes, there is a lock pick in Police Gizmo's office. Turn the lever in the middle position.

# I have it!
Change to Doctor's office mode and pick the lock.
