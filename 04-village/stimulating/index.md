# What is this?
Talk to Lonzo.

# Okay
There should be some stimulant at Doctor Gizmo's office. Turn the lever all the way up, again.

# Can't see it
Maybe it is behind locks.

# Maybe
It is in the Doctor's Cabinet. But it is locked! Mistrust everywhere!

# How do I open it?
You won't probably get the key from Gizmo. Maybe you could access it in _illegal_ ways?

# Illegal?
Yes, there is a lock pick in Police Gizmo's office. Turn the lever in the middle position.
