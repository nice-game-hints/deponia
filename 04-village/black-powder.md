# Where is it?
Well, black powder is usually used in rockets and firecrackers.

# Rockets!
Yes, you just played, quite unsuccessfully, with some.

# To Toni's backyard
There is a dud there from your heroic attempt.

# Nice, a rocket!
Well, the powder is still inside the rocket.

# How to get it out
Maybe you could drill it out. [How to get the drill.](drill.md)
Use the drill to the rocket (kids, do not try this at home!) and you have the powder.
