One ingredient of the coffee powder is Black powder.

# Where is some?
Well, black powder is usually used in rockets and firecrackers.

## Tell me where I used rockets
Yes, you just played, quite unsuccessfully, with some. ^[ Go to Toni's backyard. ]

# I found a rocket
There is a dud on Toni's backyard from your heroic attempt. The powder is still inside the rocket.

## How to get the powder out of the rocket?
Maybe you could [drill](drill.md) it out.

# I have a drill
Use the drill to the rocket (kids, do not try this at home!) and you have some black powder.
