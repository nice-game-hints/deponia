# Coffee, where?
Hmm.. Toni's coffee machine is broken. Can you find a bar somewhere?
There is Lonzo's bar in the Alley.

# Lonzo's
Talk to Lonzo until he comes up with the idea of brewing the espresso.
You get the receipt of the coffee from him.

# Ingredients
Here's the receipt for the best Goal-waking coffee:
 * [Revivitalizing Liquid](revivitalizing-liquid.md)
 * [Energy-rich Water](energy-rich/index.md)
 * [Clear Water](clear-water.md)
 * [Coffee Powder](coffee-powder.md)
   * [Hot beans](hot-beans.md)
   * [Black Powder](black-powder.md)
   * [Extraordinarily Stimulating](stimulating/index.md)

# Phew, got them all!
Insert the Coffee Powder (it has to be grinded!) into the machine. Mix other stuff
(Clear Water, Revivitalizing Liquid and Energy-Rich Water) into the glass and pour it in.

# Am I dead?
No, but you have the coffee!
