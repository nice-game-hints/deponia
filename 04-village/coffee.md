Goal needs awakening coffee to wake up.

# Coffee, where?
Hmm.. Toni's coffee machine is broken. Can you find a bar somewhere?
There is Lonzo's bar in the Alley.

# I am at Lonzo's
Talk to Lonzo until he comes up with the idea of brewing the espresso.
You get the receipt of the coffee from him.

# Show me the ingredients
Here's the receipt for the best Goal-waking coffee:
 - [Revivitalizing Liquid](revivitalizing-liquid.md)
 - [Energy-rich Water](energy-rich/index.md)
 - [Clear Water](clear-water.md)
 - [Coffee Powder](coffee-powder.md)
   - [Hot beans](hot-beans.md)
   - [Black Powder](black-powder.md)
   - [Extraordinarily Stimulating](stimulating/index.md)

## Phew, got them all! How to do it?
Insert the Coffee Powder (it has to be [grinded](coffee-powder.md)!) into the machine. Mix other stuff
(Clear Water, Revivitalizing Liquid and Energy-Rich Water) into the glass and pour it in.

# Am I dead?
No, but you have the coffee!
