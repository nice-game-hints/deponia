# Line
Is it your turn already?

# No...
Did you take a number?

# Yes
And offer it to Lotti? You would have to get rid of the line.

# How?
Maybe if you could cause some problem at their homes they would leave.

# Yes, good idea!
Like, all three simultaneously. Little rumble if you know what I mean.

# Rumble?
Hannek, at the Alley, could cause some turmoil in selected spots.

# Talked to Hannek
You should mark the detonation spots on the detonation plan with something magnetic and then ring the bell.

# Magnetic
You know these magnets on whiteboards that keep the public announcements on place.

# Public announcements?
Yes, on Town halls. Get the magnets from the Town hall whiteboard.

# So, detonation
Now, mark the correct places with the magnets and ring the bell.

# Correct places?
Well, the guys in line, of course. That's who you wanted to cause the turmoil to.

# But, where do they live?
What's with the hats, by the way? Chat with them about those things.

# Okay
He said the _roofer_ has started to make hats. That is weird.

# Well, it is!
Should the hat match the roof then?

# Umm.. don't get it
Place the magnets to houses (yellow dots) with roofs matching the three guys' hats and ring the bell.

The line is free!

# But 66 is still too much
Check out the floor

# Oh.. 63!
There is a number 63 on the floor. Pick it up and off to Lotti!

# Wenzel!
