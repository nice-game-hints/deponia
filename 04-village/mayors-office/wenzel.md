# Wenzel
Wenzel's house is in the bottom

# He's lazy
Yeah, he would like to bring water to the Mayor. He thinks he might have a water vein in his basement.

# But there isn't
But there seems to be water reservoir on _top_ of his apartment. You could pour down water through the chimney.

# I tried
Yes, the pipe does not stop on top of the chimney. And there is a lid.
Maybe you could devise an impromptu lid-opener and pipe-stoppener.

# Lid-opener and pipe.. what?
Fill the lid open with something and at the same time stop the pipe. Easy.

# With what?
For lifting you could use for example a balloon. There was a feast at the Town hall some time ago.

# Balloons
Get the balloons from the Assembly Hall behind the wooden door. Use the doorknob.

# And then?
An empty balloon does not lift anything.

# I should fill it
There is laughing gas in Doctor Gizmo's office. Pull the lever most up and fill the balloon with laughing gas.

# Nice balloon
It is. If you let go of it, it will fly away.

# That's true
Some kind of hook would attach the balloon to the lid so it won't fly away.
[How to get the hook.][hook]

# Hooked! Myself that is
Combine the hook and the balloon. The impromptu devise is ready!

# What next?
Now, to open the lid of the chimney.

# Chimney
You would have to do it beneath. Wenzel does all his cookings in his bathroom.
There is a furnace. Put the balloon (and the hook) into the furnace.

# Nice!
Go kick the pipe and pull the lever to get the (dirty) water flowing into the chimney.

# The draining does its job
Yes, so, to get the basement to flood with water.

# Some blumping work
Usually the blumping does not work at Deponia. Maybe you could "fix" the pipe in the basement.

# Like?
Like drilling a hole into the pipe. [How to get the drill.][drill]

# No water?
Go and pull the lever again. Heh heh, poor Wenzel...

# Bloody Wenzel!
Argh! But at least he took his place in the queue, finally!
