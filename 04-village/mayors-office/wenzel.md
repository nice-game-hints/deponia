You would need to get Wenzel into Mayor's office.

# Where is he?
Wenzel's house is in the bottom

# He's lazy
Yeah, Wenzel would like to bring water to the Mayor. He thinks he might have a water vein in his basement.

# But there isn't
But there seems to be water reservoir on _top_ of Wenzel's apartment.

## Go on...
You could pour down water into Wenzel's chimney.

# I tried to move the pipe on top of the chimney
Yes, the pipe does not stop on top of the chimney. And there is a lid.
Maybe you could devise an impromptu _lid-opener and pipe-stoppener_.

# Lid-opener and pipe.. what?
Pull the chimney lid open with something and at the same time stop the pipe on top of it. Easy.

# How do I stop the pipe and open the lid?
For lifting you could use something floating. There was a feast at the Town hall some time ago.

## Tell me what should I use to stop the pipe
Get the balloons from the Assembly Hall behind the wooden door. Use the doorknob.

# I have a balloon
An empty balloon does not lift anything.

# I should fill the balloon
Balloons are filled with gas.

## Where is gas for the balloon?
There is laughing gas in Doctor Gizmo's office. Pull the lever most up and fill the balloon with laughing gas.

# I have that nice balloon
It is. If you let go of the balloon, it will fly away and most definitely won't stop the pipe and open the lid.

## What should I use to prevent the balloon from escaping?
Some kind of [hook](hook.md) would attach the balloon to the lid so it won't fly away.

# I have a hook
Combine the hook and the balloon. The impromptu devise to keep the lid open and stop the pipe is ready!

# What next?
Now, use the balloon to open the lid of the chimney. You would have to do it beneath. 

## Tell me how to use the balloon
Wenzel does all his cookings in his bathroom.
There is a furnace. Put the balloon (and the hook) into the furnace.
It will raise the lid and the balloon is there to stop the pipe.

# Nice! What next?
Go kick the pipe and pull the lever to get the (dirty) water flowing into the chimney.

# The draining does its job
Yes, the water is not staying in the basement where it should.

# Any hints on that?
Usually the blumping does not work at Deponia. Maybe you could "fix" the pipe in the basement.

## Like?
Like drilling a hole into the pipe. [Go get a drill.](../drill.md)

# I drilled the pipe but still no water
Go and pull the lever again. Heh heh, poor Wenzel...

# Bloody Wenzel!
Argh! But at least he took his place in the queue, finally!
