One ingredient for the awakening coffee is Revivitalizing Liquid.

# Any hints?
As with every ingredient, talk to Lonzo. Making inanimate life again?
Doesn't it make you feel like a young _bull_ again?

## Bull...
There is an inanimate bull at the Front Gate!

# It's lifeless
That bull's blood is no good. You could use Wenzel's as well (that wasn't a hint! Don't go to Wenzel.)

# I need more life to the bull
It looks like the bull is missing something, or _someone_?

## Who is he missing?
A lady bull! Picture would probably also suffice. Go find a picture.

## Where do I get a picture of a lady bull
I think there was one at Lonzo's wall.

# What next?
Well, you, of course, show the picture to the bull.

# The bull isn't mad enough about seeing the lady bull
What would make the bull more mad than giving it a companion?

## I don't know, what?
Of course taking the lady bull picture away. Or _hiding it_. You know, bulls don't like the red color.

## What do I hide the lady bull picture with?
There is a red carpet on Lonzo's floor. Throw it over the bulletin board. Now the bull's blood is ready.

# How do I get the boold out of the bull?
How do you get blood out of a bull? Or from a human?

## Tell me what
Syringe, of course. Did you know Gizmo is also a doctor? He could have [a syringe](stimulating/index.md) in his office.
