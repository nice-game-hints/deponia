# Any hints?
As with every ingredient, talk to Lonzo. Making inanimate life again?
Does it make you feel like a young bull again?

# Bull...
There is an inanimate bull at the Front Gate!

# It's lifeless
That bull's blood is no good. You could use Wenzel's as well (that wasn't a hint! Don't go to Wenzel.)

# More life to the bull
It looks like the bull is missing something, or someone?

# A lady bull?
Yes, a lady bull! Picture would probably also suffice.

# Picture of a lady bull
I think there was one at Lonzo's wall.

# That's right
I know. I am that good.

# What next?
Well, you of course show the picture to the bull.

# It isn't mad enough
What would make the bull more mad than giving it a companion?

# I don't know, what?
Of course taking it away. Or hiding it. You know, bulls don't like the red color.

# Hide it with..
There is a red carpet on Lonzo's floor. Throw it over the bulletin board. Now the bull's blood is ready.

# How do I...
How do you get blood out of a bull? Or from a human?

# Syringe!
That's right. Did you know Gizmo is also a doctor? He could have a syringe in his office.
