# Ouch, those are fiery!
Could you protect your hands with some kind of fire repellent gloves?

## Where do I get those?
Did you listen to Gizmo? He is also a firefighter!

# He is!
He has the Emergency Station next to the bar.

# Cool, a fire station?
Yes, pull the lever all the way down to transfer it to a fire station mode. Grab the gloves.
Use the gloves to protect your hand while harvesting the chili.
