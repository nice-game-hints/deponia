# Who grows those?
Toni has extraordinary taste in decorative plants.

# She has?
You probably noticed that when you screw the mailbox off.

# Oh yeah
There are chili peppers growing in front of Toni's house.

# Ouch, those are fiery!
Could you protect your hands with some kind of fire repellent gloves?

# Where do I get those?
Did you listen to Gizmo? He is also a firefighter!

# He is!
He has the Emergency Station next to the bar.

# Cool, a fire station?
Yes, pull the lever all the way down to transfer it to a fire station mode. Grab the gloves.
