# Goal does not wake up
Did you talk to Gizmo? He is next to Goal in the Town Hall

# Yes
He mentioned something to wake her up. Really strong coffee ought to do it!

# I have the coffee
Off you go. Treat her!

# Gizmo!
As long as Dr. Gizmo is next to her he won't let you "medicate" her.

# Doctor...
Maybe if you would get him to do some of his other duties and distract him.

# Fire!
Yes, tell him there's fire.

# No dice
He doesn't believe you. Maybe you should.. hmm..

# Fire!
Cause a fire! Nice thinking. What's that there in the back? Where the balloons were.

# Cardboard
You pyromaniac! Torch it!

# My torch?
Yeah, I think you left it at Toni's backyard.

# My torch!
Fire! Actual fire! Gizmo to the rescue! Time for coffee.

# Mayor!
Now the mayor is giving you a hard time. Maybe you could fool the Mayor to think that you are a doctor.
Grab the stetoscope.

# Grabbed!
Uh oh! Gizmo went full police mode. Quick, frame someone!

# Untouchable
Well done. Gizmo will take the Mayor to the cell.

# Umm.. no?
Oh yeah. Well they are arguing and you can give coffee to Goal.

# It will spill everywhere
Yes, pouring coffee into someone's mouth while they are sleeping is hard, indeed. This calls for a funnel!

# Funnel?
There is a funnel in Toni's backyard. It broke from your escape pod.

# Done
Put the funnel on Goal and pour in the coffee.
