Goal is sleeping at the Town Hall.

# Goal does not wake up
Did you talk to Gizmo? He is next to Goal in the Town Hall

# I talked to Gizmo
He mentioned something to wake her up. Really [strong coffee](coffee.md) ought to do it!

# I have the awakening coffee
Off you go. Treat her with the coffee!

# Gizmo is blocking me!
As long as Dr. Gizmo is next to her he won't let you "medicate" her.

# How to get rid of Gizmo?
Maybe if you would get him to do some of his other duties and distract him.

# Fire?
Yes, you could tell him there's fire somewhere.

# He doesn't believe it
Maybe you should.. actually...

## Fire!
Cause an actual fire! Nice thinking. What's that there in the back? Where the balloons were.

# Cardboard
Set the cardboard on fire. Use your torch ^[ It is in Toni's backyard. ].

# Gizmo is in firefighting mode
But now the mayor is giving you a hard time. Maybe you could fool the Mayor to think that you are a doctor.
Grab the stetoscope.

# Grabbed!
Uh oh! Gizmo went full police mode. Quick, frame someone! Frame the mayor.

# They are arguing
Oh yeah. While they are arguing and you can give coffee to Goal.

# It will spill everywhere
Yes, pouring coffee into someone's mouth while they are sleeping is hard, indeed. This calls for a funnel ^[ There is a funnel in Toni's backyard. It broke from your escape pod. ].

# I have the funnel
Put the funnel on Goal and pour in the coffee.
