You need socks. You leave your stuff laying in most bizarre places!

# Like?
Like the fridge!

# And?
And your jacket!

# And?
And under you (cheesy) pillow!

# I have now three socks!
Yeah, but they are not the same color. You are not a barbarian, aren't you.

# But... I have three socks
Yes, yes. A green, yellow and blue. There is something to those colors...

# 1+1 is..
That's right! Yellow and blue makes green.

# So, mixing those together...
You get green socks, that is right. Have you ever washed different colored clothing before?

# Washing machine
There is not washing machine, you need to come up with something _like_ a washing machine.

# For washing, you need detergent
Yes, that is true. Look around for the detergent ^[ You can find some detergent from the locker on 2nd floor. ]

# I have the detergent
But not just detergent, you need also...

# ..water?
Water (at least sort of) comes from the tap. And it needs to be warmed ^[ Use the oven ].

## Tell me how to get hot water
There is an oven on the 1st floor. And a pot to heat the water in the kitchen sink. Take the pot and fill it with water from the tap.
Put the water filled pot on the oven.

# It is not boiling
If you wait long enough the sun will expand and warm the earth to temperatures that will boil all water. But we don't have
that much time. Maybe you should fire up the oven.

# Fire, fire...
Maybe you could find something to burn in the oven. Something useless and annoying.

# Annoying stuff to burn in the oven?
Tori's notes are quite annoying and useless. Collect all five of them around the house and put them in the oven to boil the water. ^[ You'll find the hidden one if you try to sneak into Tori's room. ]

## How to set the notes on fire?
Torch them! With the torch. ^[ You can find it from the 3rd floor. ]

# Let's wash the socks!
Now you have some hot water. Just add the detergent and three socks. Voilà, you have three green socks.

# The water on the oven is hot
Don't use you hands, dummy! You don't pick sphaghetti from a boiling water with your hands, don't you.

## What should I use?
You use a fork, of course. There is a fork in the kitchen sink on the 1st floor. Voilà, you have two green socks. Where did the one go, though?
