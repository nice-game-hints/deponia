# Tidy up!
You leave your stuff laying in most bizarre places!

# Like?
Like fridge!

# And?
And you jacket!

# And?
And under you (cheesy) pillow!

# Socks!
Yeah, but they are not the same color. You are not a barbarian, aren't you.

# But, three socks
Yes, yes. A green, yellow and blue. There is something to those colors...

# 1+1 is..
That's right! Yellow and blue makes green.

# So, mixing those together
You get green socks, that is right. Have you ever washed different colored clothing before?

# Washing machine
There is not washing machine, you need to come up with something _like_ a washing machine.

# For washing, you need water and...
Not just any water, *hot* water. And some detergent.

# Detergent?
You have to try yourself a little. You can find some detergent from the locker on 2nd floor.

# And hot water
Well, water (at least sort of) comes from the tap. It needs to be warmed.

# The oven!
Yes, there is an oven on the 1st floor. And a pot to heat the water in the kitchen sink. Take the pot and fill it with water.
Put the water filled pot on the oven.

# It is not boiling
If you wait long enough the sun will expand and warm the earth to temperatures that will boil all water. But we don't have
that much time. Maybe you should fire up the oven.

# Fire, fire...
Maybe you could find something to burn in the oven. Something useless and annoying.

# Annoying
Tori's notes are quite annoying and useless. Collect all five of them around the house and put them in the oven.
You'll find the hidden one if you try to sneak into Tori's room.

# Fire!
Torch them! Oh yeah, with the torch. You can find it from the 3rd floor.

# Washing machine
Now you have hot water. Just add the detergent and three socks. Voilà, you have three green socks.

# But, it's hot...
Don't use you hands, dummy! You don't pick sphaghetti from a boiling water with your hands, don't you.

# I use..
You use a fork, of course. There is a fork in the kitchen sink on the 1st floor. Voilà, you have two green socks (what just happened?).
