Rufus needs a toothbrush to get into his voyage.

# Where is it?
The toothbrush is of course next to the washbasin on the 2nd floor. That's it, onwards!

# Wait!
Did you get it? Maybe you could trap it with something.

# How to trap the toothbrush?
Like, a mouse trap. The closets are full of mice.

## Closets?
There is a closet in the bottom floor. Try there.

# The closet won't open
You need some kind of device to open the closet. Like an impromptu handle!

# Can't handle this...
One way to attach a handle to a door would be using suction.

# Ok
Maybe there is a plunger somewhere in the house.

## Where do I find the handle for the closet door?
In the toilet. Open the bathroom door and take the plunger. Use it on the closet door.

# Nice! What were we after again?
The mouse trap? Inside the closet. Go on, don't be scared.

# Ouch!
You can use the mouse trap to catch that cocky toothbrush! You just need a bait. Go through your stuff.

## Wait! Bait?
Yeah, bait to catch the toothbrush with the mouse trap.
Maybe you could sacrifice one of your precious [provisions](01-provisions.md) for a good cause.

# I have the provisions
Combine the provisions with the mouse trap and use the combined wasabi-trap on the dark corner between the 1st and 2nd floor stairs.
