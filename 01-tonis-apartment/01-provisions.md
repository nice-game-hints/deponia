# Read
Read all the notes Toni left you.

# Eat
You shouldn't eat on the sofa!

# Wasabi
Those wasabi peas will make good provisions for the journey. If you pick them up now, they would be all over the place.

# Container
Maybe some kind of container would keep them in one place.

# What kind of...
Mayb something oily...

# Oily?
There is an oil can in Rufus' room bench.

# They won't fit
Well, obviously you can't fill the can full of oil with peas. Get rid of the oil first.

# Where?
Just pour the oil to one of the sinks and use the empty oil can on the sofa.
