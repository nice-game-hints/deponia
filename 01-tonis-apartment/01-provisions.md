Read all the notes Toni left you.

# What about them?
You shouldn't eat on the sofa! Click on the sofa.

# Wasabi peas
Those wasabi peas will make good provisions for the journey. If you pick them up now, they would be all over the place.
Maybe some kind of container would keep them in one place.

# What kind of container for the peas?
Maybe something oily...

## Tell me what is oily
There is an oil can in Rufus' room bench.

# They won't fit in
Well, obviously you can't fill the can full of oil with peas. Get rid of the oil first.

## Where to empty the can?
Just pour the oil to one of the sinks and use the empty oil can on the sofa.
