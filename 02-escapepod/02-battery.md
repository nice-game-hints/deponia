# The battery
Could you sit on a battery? Like, remove the seat. That's useless anyway.

# But it's screwed tight
Look around. Any tools that could help you?

# I don't know
There is a wrench next to the harpoon. Go grab it and unscrew the seat.

# No seat, no... seat
Hmm... yes. Maybe sitting on the plain battery is little off-putting. If you could cover the battery with something.
Something you could sit on.

# Don't remember seeing anything like that
Here's an (actual) hint. The front door at Tori's apartment is now open.

# I see...
You see. You see the mailbox, right? It is _screwed_ thight.

# It is
Unscrew the mailbox in front of Tori's apartment with the wrench.

# A seat!
Yes, the mailbox acts as a seat. Go and attach it to the base plate and stick the battery into the mailbox.

You pod is ready to launch!
