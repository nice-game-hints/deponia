Goal's cartridge is little dusty. Maybe you can clean it.

# Dust?
There is a duster under the ramp.

# Dusting away!
Didn't Bozo say he used to clean the tanks? If you used it to the cartridge there is grease everywhere!

# Yuck
There must be degreaser somewhere. Like, outside.

# In the?
In the chest outside.

# Locked
You can open it with the key you find on the floor next to the duster.

# Of course, key
Yeah, it's that simple sometimes. There are the steel brush and the degreaser in the chest.

# Cleaning
If you look at the cartridge you have a skippable minigame to fully clean the cartridge.
