There must be a radio somewhere. Have you asked around?

# Like, who?
Go ask Lotti at the Town Hall.

# There is a Radio
The radio is in the Post Office (next to Lotti's booth).
Did you try to enter the Post Office?

# I can't get in
What did Lotti say?

# Something about a clock
The (missing) clock in the sign says when the post office opens.
