After you have [got rid of the Postbot](/05-village/020-postbot/index.md), you have access to the Clock Face.

# Under the note
Yes, remove the note first from the door.

# Holes?
I think the note and the holes are the key to the vault.

# Four numbers
Four numbers in the key, four holes in the note.

# Where to use the note?
Take the note from you inventory and position it above the mailboxes.

# Numbers
And read the numbers. First hole, first number. Second hole, third number, etc...

## Help me
So, the key is 3,6,4,9.
