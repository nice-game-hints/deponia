Radio is in the [Post Office](/05-village/010-post-office.md). There is a Postbot blocking your way.

# Try to bypass it
Error! Error! Talk to the Postbot.

# It has lots to say
Yeah, all kinds of things about bubblewrap and replacement cats.

# Bubblewrap
The bot is interested in bubble wrap that he gets his hands on when a small package is packaged in too large box.

# Cats?
The cats are in the hatches. The cats do the work.

# Upstairs
Have you visited upstairs? Visit the Phone Operators Platform from the Postal Office.

# Pigeons!
Nice pigeons. Easily distracted by a magnetic field.

# But, the robot!
Yes, you should get rid of the Postbot. [Have you seen how the postal system works?](/05-village/030-get-the-vouchers.md) With the voucher you dispatch one _light_ package that gets one stamp (package level one), checked by the Postbot and a small pigeon carries it. Interesting...

# It is!
Maybe you could sabotage the system somehow. It has worked before, you know.

# Sabotage!
You try to get the small pigeon to carry too heavy package with extra wrapping.

# Crash!
If you did it right. There should be bubblewrap all over the place!

#  Postbot fetishes
Just walk on the bubblewrap until the Postbot loses it.
