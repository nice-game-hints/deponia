The telephone operator (on top of the Post Office) has earphones.

# He doesn't give them
Well, yeah? He needs them for his work.

# He looks chill
Yeah, the guy has the easiest job (except Wenzel) in Kuvaq! No hassle, just chilling.

# Hassle
Could you cause some hassle. Some work to get him tired.

# Like
Like causing lots of local calls in Kuvaq simultaenously!

# Where?
There are three places in Kuvaq to make local calls:
 - [Emergency Phone](055-call-emergency.md)
 - [Teletypewriter](057-teletypewriter.md)
 - [Communicator](058-communicator.md)
 
# Nervous breakdown
The operator's day is ruined! Go grab the headphones from him.
