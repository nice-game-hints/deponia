There is an emergency phone in the village center.

# Hello?
You phoned with it? What did Gizmo say?

# To get away from the line
Yeah, he recognized you. Maybe someone else could do it

# But who?
Someone talkative...

# Toni?
...who doesn't hate you! Toni probably has all kinds of complaints about you to tell Gizmo but she is not willing to do it.

# Hmm... no one comes to mind
It doesn't have to be _human_, you know...

# Not human?
There is a quite talkative parrot next to Hannek in the Alley.

# Parrot can talk to Gizmo!
Yes, get that animal to the phone! [How to get the parrot](056-get-parrot.md)

# Nonsense
(Is the parrot awake, btw?) Yes, Inspector Gizmo is not interested in the parrots current record.

# Re-record
Maybe someone could give the parrot more serious issues to repeat. Have you looked hint about the parrot by looking it in your inventory.

# Toni!
Yeah, she might have all kinds of ... stories about certain someone that Inspector Gizmo would like to hear.

# That is true
So, get the parrot into Toni's store and put him on the pole. Get it back after it has soaked something to tell to Gizmo.

# Try again
Get the bird to the emergency phone to keep the line busy.
