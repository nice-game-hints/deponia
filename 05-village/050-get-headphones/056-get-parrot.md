Parrot is in the Alley, next to Hannek yabbing around

# The parrot is quite livid
Maybe you could somehow anesthesizise it.

# With what?
I don't know. Maybe some doctor would have that kind of gear?

# Dr. Gizmo!
Yes, the laughing gas would suffice.

# How do I apply the laughing gas?
You _apply_ it by moving the gas in a *container* into the bird.

## What container should I use to move the laughing gas?
Balloon is designed to hold gas. Fill a balloon with the laughing gas.

# Balloon is filled with gas
Go and pass the gas to the parrot.

# The parrot is now stunned
Congrats! You have a stunned parrot.

# But... the parrot is not stunned
Hmm.. yes, you cannot use stunned parrot. Try to wake it up.

# With what?
You have waked someone else up already before...

## Tell me what to use to wake up the parrot
Give the parrot some coffee.
