Parrot is in the Alley, next to Hannek yabbing around

# He is quite livid
Maybe you could somehow anesthesizise it.

# With what?
I don't know. Maybe some doctor would have that kind of gear?

# Dr. Gizmo!
Yes, the laughing gas would suffice.

# How do I apply it?
You _apply_ it by moving the gas in a container into the bird.

# Container?
Balloon is designed to hold gas. Fill a balloon with the laughing gas.

# Filled!
Go and _pass the gas_ to the parrot.

# Stunned!
Congrats! You have a stunned parrot.

# But...
Hmm.. yes, you cannot use stunned parrot. Try to wake it up.

# With what?
You have waked someone else up already before...

# True!
Give the parrot some coffee
