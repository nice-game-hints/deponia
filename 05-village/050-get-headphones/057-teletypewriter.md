Teletypewriter in the Mayor's Office will keep the line busy.

# I can't be there all the time
Did you look at the writer for hints?

# I did
It looked like a _cat_ would be jumping over the writer.

## Where would I get a cat?
There are cats in the Post Office.

# The cats are working
Yeah, the two are stationed. Is there a replacement?

## I need a replacement cat
Open the Replacement Cat's Hatch and grap the replacement cats from the replacement cat's hatch.

# I have the replacement cat
Put the cat on the teletypewriter.
