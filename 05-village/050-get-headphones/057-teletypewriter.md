Teletypewriter in the Mayor's Office will keep the line busy.

# I can't be there all the time
Did you look at the writer for hints?

# I did
It looked like a _cat_ would be jumping over the writer.

# Cat
There are cats in the Post Office.

# They are working
Yeah, the two are stationed. Is there a replacement?

# Replacement cat
Open the Replacement Cat's Hatch and grap the replacement cats from the replacement cat's hatch.

# Catwork
Put the cat into the teletypewriter
