The vouchers are perfect for demoing the working of the cats.

# Where to get them?
Who would sell gitf vouchers to post?

# Toni..
There are vouchers in Toni's store. She won't just hand them to you.

# She is stunning
Did you say stunned?

# No...
Good idea! Stun her!

# With what?
Tony needs to tranquil all the time.

# She does?
Yes, she has some tranquilizers at her home.

# That is true
Open the First Aid box with the First Aid kit key and grab the stuff.

# She won't take it
Maybe you could inject it somehow.

# Like with..
Like with a dart! There was a dart board at Lonzo's. Combine the dart with the tranquilizer.

# And then...
You can't just stick it to her. You need a blowpipe of some kind.

# Blowpipe
Well, you could use the funnel as an impromptu blowpipe. Get it from the Assembly Hall. Don't start shooting inside, then!

# Outside
Combine the funnel and the prepared dart and use them on Toni's Shop's window *outside*. Toni is stunned and the vouchers are free to grab!
