The vouchers are perfect for demoing the working of the cats.

# Where to get gift vouchers?
Who would sell gift vouchers to post?

## Tell me where to find gift vouchers
There are vouchers in Toni's store. She won't just hand them to you.

# She is stunning
Did you say stunned?

# No...
Good idea! Stun her!

# With what?
Tony needs to tranquil all the time.

# She does?
Yes, she has some tranquilizers at her home.

## Where do I find the tranquilizers?
Open the First Aid box with the First Aid kit key and grab the stuff.

# She won't take the tranquilizer
Maybe you could inject it somehow into her.

## What should I use to inject the tranquilizer
You could use a dart ^[ There was a dart board at Lonzo's. ]! Combine the dart with the tranquilizer.

# How do I apply the dart to Toni?
You can't just stick the tranquilizer dart into her. You need a *blowpipe* of some kind.

## Where do I get a blowpipe?
Well, you could use the funnel as an impromptu blowpipe. Get it from the Assembly Hall. Don't start shooting inside, then!

## How do I shoot Toni with the dart?
Combine the funnel and the prepared dart and use them on Toni's Shop's window *outside*. Toni is stunned and the vouchers are free to grab!
