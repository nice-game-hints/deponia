Remember that the speed comes from the orange cat and the white cat licks the stamps.

# So...
You want the light package to be marked as level three package.

# I need more stamps...
Make the white cat faster.

# With?
Espresso, of course.

# And the orange cat?
Make it slower.

# With...
With the tranquilizer, of course.
