Radio is in the [Post Office](/05-village/010-get-to-post-office.md). There is a Postbot blocking your way.

# I can't bypass it
Error! Error! Talk to the Postbot.

# The Postbot has lots to say
Yeah, all kinds of things about bubblewrap and replacement cats.

# Bubblewrap and cats?
The bot is interested in bubble wrap that he gets his hands on when a small package is packaged in too large box.
The cats are in the hatches. The cats do the work.

# How should I proceed?
Have you visited upstairs? Visit the Phone Operators Platform from the Postal Office.

# There are pigeons!
Nice pigeons. Easily distracted by a magnetic field.

# But, how to bypass the robot?
Yes, you should get rid of the Postbot. [Have you seen how the postal system works?](030-get-the-vouchers.md) With the voucher you dispatch one _light_ package that gets one stamp (package level one), checked by the Postbot and a small pigeon carries it. Interesting...

# It is!
Maybe you could sabotage the system somehow. It has worked before, you know.

## How do I sabotage the mailing system?
You try to get the small pigeon to carry too heavy package with extra wrapping.

 * [Sabotage the cats!](036-sabotage-cats.md)
 
# Crash!
If you did it right. There should be bubblewrap all over the place!

## How do I get the Postbot away?
Just walk on the bubblewrap until the Postbot loses it.
