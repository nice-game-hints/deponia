The pigeons use magnetic fields for navigation.

# Where do I begin finding magnetic stuff?
Have you checked the Mayor's Office?

# Where there?
The desk works as a cupboard and a bed.

## What should I do to the bed?
The Mayor slept in the bed. You can change the mode using the Divining Rod on the Water Emblem and pressing the Bell.

## It is now in the bed mode
Under the cushion you find the Planet's Magnetic Field gadget.

# I have the gadget
On the Phone Operators Platform insert the Magnetic Field gadget into the cupboard.
It is a skippable minipuzzle. It is ready when the smallest red bird is in the largest hole.
