You should contact Cletus with a radio.

# Where do I get a radio?
There is a radio in the [Post Office](010-get-to-post-office.md). You have to get into the [Vault](040-get-into-the-vault.md) past the [Postbot](020-postbot/index.md)

# I got in the vault
Do you have the [Headphones](050-get-headphones/index.md) and the microphone? ^[ Microphone is at the Assembly Hall. Just go and add one more theft into your list of illegal actions in Kuvaq. ]

# I got the microphone
Go to the Vault, attach the microphone and headphones and call Cletus.
