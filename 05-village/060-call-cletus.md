You should contact Cletus with a radio.

# Radio
There is a radio in the [Post Office](010-get-to-post-office.md). You have to get into the [Vault](040-get-into-the-vault.md) past the [Postbot](020-postbot.md)

# Done
Do you have the [Headphones](050-get-headphones.md) and the microphone?

# Mic?
Microphone is at the Assembly Hall. Just go and add one more theft into your list of illegal actions in Kuvaq.

# Hey!
You are leaving anyways. Go to the Vault, attach the microphone and headphones and call Cletus.
