Post Office is at the Town Hall. 

# I can't get in the post office
What did Lotti say?

# Something about a clock
The (missing) clock in the sign says when the post office opens.

# Where do I get a clock?
Who has a clock hanging from his neck?

## Tell me who!
Lotek! He is sleeping in the Assembly Hall. Taking the clock from him is straightforward.

# I have the clock
Put the clock into the Opening Hours slot and the Post Office is open!
