What did Lotti say?

# Something about a clock
The (missing) clock in the sign says when the post office opens.

# A clock
Who has a clock hanging from his neck?

He is sleeping in the Assembly Hall. Taking the clock is straightforward.

# Opening hours!
Put the clock into the Opening Hours slot and the Post Office is open!
