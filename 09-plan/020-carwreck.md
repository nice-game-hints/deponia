You are in the car wreck. I think the way of the canopy top gets you to the Crane.

# It's closed
Yes, it is attached to the Hood. It is hold open with the red lever.

# Can't reach it
It can't be just removed. Maybe you could shoot it down?

# Shoot, with what?
With the fork, of course!

# Of course
You get the fork from the French Door. It opens with the Crank you reach from the Left Window.

# I have the fork
Go to the Pipe, stick the fork into the Horn and use the Horn to shoot!
