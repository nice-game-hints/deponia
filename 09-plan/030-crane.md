You have passed the car wreck. The Organons are pointing their light to wrong places (Fence Exit).

# Platypus
It is making a sound that attracts the Organon's light.

# Noise
When the you walk over the board with the Platypus **in** it the Organon will direct the light briefly away from the Fence Exit.

# Yes?
You should time your movement from *right* of the board with platypus to the Fence Exit so tha the Organon will point the light away.

# So?
I think the Organon will every other time defocus the light. So take care that you are on the *right* side of the board when he does *not* defocus the light from the Exit. Then place the Platypus in the board and walk to the Fence Exit. You should be on the crane.

# Do it!
Pull the Crane Lever, you genius!
