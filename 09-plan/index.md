You have a perfect plan to get to Elysium with Goal.

# Organons
Look at the Crane Lever. Perfect plan...

# But Organons!
Oh yeah, they are blocking you. Maybe you could go [pass them](010-pass.md).

# I passed the Organons!
[Get on the top bridge.](020-carwreck.md)

# I am at the bridge
[Get on the Crane](030-crane.md), then.

# I dealt with the Organons!
Nice, off you go with Goal!

# Cletus
Let them sort it by themselves. Go try the Lifeboat.

# The ascension codes!
What's in the bag?

# A disquise!
Put on the disquise (right-click in the Inventory) and go talk to the Squabblers. Say "Don't make me laugh".

# Speedos
Yes! Do the wedgie and attach him to the flagpole!

# There he is
Off you go!

# Urm...
Yeah, didn't go like you planned? You still need the memory cartridge again. Go find it!

# Where?
Down with the elevator, into the Concourse and just take it.
