The middle hatch seems to have cogwheel and an extra hatch.

# The hatch does not open
What about the cogwheels. They seem to be well _oiled_.

# Oiled?
Yes, oil. Do you have oil with you? Or something that used to contain oil?

# I have
Yes, put one of the provisions into the cogwheels and observe the magic of self maintenance.

# It's aggressive
Well, it is active. Maybe you could try it when it is passive.

# But the door blocks it then
Yes, but the door is open (for that brief moment). Could you jam the door open somehow?

# Jamming
Put one of your socks on the hatch door (not the arm). Open the hatch door and steal the robot arm.
