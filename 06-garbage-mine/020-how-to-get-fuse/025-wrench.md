You need the wrench for ... wrenching.

# But where?
Well, there is no reasonable hint for where to find it. It is in the Keybox at the Control Center in the [Upper Level](/06-garbage-mine/030-upper-level.md).

# But it is locked.
Yes, now, it *is* a **key**box.

# Key
There is a key hanging on the hanging skeleton at the Viaduct.

# But it is too high
Luckily (not for the skeleton) it is hanging on a semaphore that can move up and down.

# Get it down
There is a Lever on the Upper Level that you can go and push. Notice the lights changing.

# Get it
Go and get the low hanging key and open the keybox. Wrench is yours!
