You need the wrench for ... wrenching.

# Where is the wrench?
Well, there is no reasonable hint for where to find it. Keep looking.

## Tell me where the wrench is
It is in the Keybox at the Control Center in the [Upper Level](/06-garbage-mine/030-upper-level.md).

# But the keybox is locked.
[Open the keybox](../035-keybox.md)
