The crane's fuse in the maintenance box was defective.

# New fuse
I think fuses are usually in maintenance hatches.

# Maintenance hatch
There is another maintenance hatch in the Viaduct (right from the Tunnel).

# It's closed
Maintenance hatches can be opened with [a Wrench](025-wrench.md).

# I have the wrench
Open the Maintenance hatch at the Viaduct with the Wrench and grab the working fuse. It fits to the maintenance box next to the Crane.
