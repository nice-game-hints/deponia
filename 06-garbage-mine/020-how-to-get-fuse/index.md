The crane's fuse in the maintenance box was defective.

# I need a new fuse
I think fuses are usually in maintenance hatches.

## Where do I find another maintenance hatch?
There is another maintenance hatch in the Viaduct (right from the Tunnel).

# The maintenance hatch is closed
Use a tool to open it. ^[ Maintenance hatches can be opened with [a Wrench](025-wrench.md). ]

# I have the tool
[A wrench](025-wrench.md)? Good.

Open the Maintenance hatch at the Viaduct with the Wrench and grab the working fuse. It fits to the maintenance box next to the Crane.
