keywords: upper, key, wrench

There is a keybox at the [upper level](/06-garbage-mine/030-upper-level.md).

# It is locked
Well, now, it *is* a **key**box.

## Where do I find the key?
There is a key hanging on the hanging skeleton at the Viaduct.

# But the key is too high
Luckily (not for the skeleton) the skeleton is hanging on a semaphore that can move up and down.

## How do I move the semaphore down?
There is a Lever on the Upper Level that you can go and push. Notice the lights changing.

# The skeleton is now down
Go and get the low hanging key and open the keybox. You get a handy wrench!

## What should I do with the wrench?
You can use it to open maintenance hatches.
