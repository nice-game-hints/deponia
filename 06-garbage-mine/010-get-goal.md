That was a bad bridge. Goal is on the other side.

# How to get her?
Really? Nothin comes to mind?

# Well...
Well, the crane, of course. Climb into the crane.

# It doesn't work
There is the maintenance box. Throw out the defective fuse and [replace it with working fuse](020-how-to-get-fuse/index.md).

# Yay! Working crane
The crane works but you can't drop Goal to the void. Get the [Mine Bike under the Funnel](050-mine-bike-to-goal.md).

# Too tense
Go ask Doc for help and [Lift Goal into the Mine Bike](060-goal-to-bike-mine/index.md).

# Drive away
Drive to the right and the go up to the Control Room. There is a skippable minigame about finding the correct route.
