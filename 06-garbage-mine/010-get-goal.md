That was a bad bridge. Goal is on the other side.

# How to pick Goal up?
Really? Nothing _big and metallic_ comes to mind?

## Tell me
Well, the crane, of course. Climb into the crane.

# The crane doesn't work
There is that maintenance box.

## What should I do to the maintenance box?
Throw out the defective fuse and [replace it with a working fuse](020-how-to-get-fuse/index.md).

# The crane is now working
The crane works but you can't drop Goal into the void. Get the [Mine Bike under the Funnel](050-mine-bike-to-goal.md).

# Rufus is too tense to finish the job
Go ask Doc for help and [lift Goal into the Mine Bike](060-goal-to-bike-mine/index.md).

# Goal is on board!
Drive to the right and the go up to the Control Room. There is a skippable minigame about finding the correct route.
