The Tunnel is so dark and your bat signals don't work.

# I need light
There is a light source next to the Tunnel that you could somehow use.

# The light source is pointing the wrong way
Hmm.. that is true. Maybe you could _mirror_ it?

## How can I mirror the light?
There is a mirror next to the tunnel. Grab it and hang it on the hanging skeleton.

# The mirror doesn't reflect enough light
The mirror is little dirty. Maybe you could [clean the mirror](055-clean-mirror.md)?

# The mirror is clean
So, the mirror is hanging with the skeleton. What else could be wrong?

## Tell me
Is the light red? You know red light doesn't help. Take the red light away.

## The red light is hot!
Shut the light down with the Lever in the Upper Level and remove it then. Replace it with the Halogen Lamp and light it up.

# The mirror is still not reflecting
Is the mirror hanging high enough? You should get it up. ^[ Use the lever to move the skeleton. ]

## The mirror is higher but the light is still not working!
Oh yeah, the lights are in wrong phase. If the light is on, the signal is down, and vice versa. Could you _fix_ the signal to _inverted position_?

## How to invert the phase and light?
Fix it by putting the Bi-Nausal Power Inverter into the signal fuse box.
