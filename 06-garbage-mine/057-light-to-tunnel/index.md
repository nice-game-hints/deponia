The Tunnel is so dark and your bat signals don't work.

# Light
There is a light source next to the Tunnel that you could somehow use.

# It is pointing wrong way
Hmm.. yes. Maybe you could mirror it?

# Mirror
There is a mirror next to the tunnel. Grab it and hang it on the hanging skeleton.

# It doesn't reflect
It is a little dirty. Maybe you could [clean it](055-clean-mirror.md)?

# It's clean
Is the light red? You know red light doesn't help. Take the red light away.

# It's hot!
Shut the light down with the Lever in the Upper Level and remove it then. Replace it with the Halogen Lamp and light it up.

# Still not reflecting
Is the mirror hanging high enough?

# No
So you should get it up. With the Lever...

# But the light!
Oh yeah, they are in wrong phase. If the light is on the signal is down and vice versa. Could you _fix_ the signal to inverted position?

# Fix it
Fix it by putting the Bi-Nausal Power Inverter into the signal fuse box.
