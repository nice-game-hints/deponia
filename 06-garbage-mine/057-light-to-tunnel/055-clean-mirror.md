The mirror is not reflecting the light because it is dirty. Clean it!

# How to clean the mirror?
Toni has probably trained you well. You need some cloth and cleaning liquid.

# Where do I get cleaning liquid?
Booze would be quite good for removing dirt.

## Where do I find booze?
Doc has the booze bottle. He promises a sip for you.

# The booze tastes good
Yes, and you left a surprise for him to the bottle. Clean the bottle.

## What should I use to clean the bottle?
There is a Cloth in the Control Room. That should suffice.

# I have the cloth
Use it on the bottle. The bottle is now clean and the cloth is soaked with alcohol.

## What next?
You were cleaning the mirror, remember? You can now clean the mirror with the soaked cloth.
