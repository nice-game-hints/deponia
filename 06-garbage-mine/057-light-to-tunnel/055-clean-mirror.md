The mirror is dirty. Clean it!

# With?
Toni has probably trained you. You need some cloth and cleaning liquid.

# Liquid
Booze would be quite good for removing dirt.

# Booze!
Doc has the booze bottle. He promises a sip for you.

# Tastes good
Yes, and you left a surprise for him to the bottle. Go clean it, once!

# Cleaning...
There is a Cloth in the Control Room. That would suffice.

# Clean
The bottle is clean and the cloth is soaked with alcohol.

# Hey...
You can now clean the mirror with the soaked cloth.
