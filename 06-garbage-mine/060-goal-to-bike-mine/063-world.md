Part of the meditation is to tell the World who you are.

# Who am I?
When you look at the horizon you see all those letters.

# Which letters to pick from the horizon?
Did you notice how Doc did it? RIVER!

# No, I didn't
He picked the letters from bottom right, then up, then far left up and then down.

## Tell me what letters to use
It's PUPUP (what does it mean, anyway?)
