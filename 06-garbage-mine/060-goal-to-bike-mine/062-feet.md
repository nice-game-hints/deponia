For relaxation, Doc instructed Rufus to lodge a feet behind his head. We both know Rufus is not *that* flexible handyman!

# Where to get *a* feet behind his head?
It doesn't really have to be Rufus' feet, you know.

# Who's feet should I use then?
Who could give you a leg?

## Tell me whod doesn't need their leg anymore
The skeleton at the Viaduct doesn't need his leg anymore. Go grab his leg.

## I took the leg from the skeleton
When you sit in the crane put the leg behind the seat.
