We both know Rufus is not *that* flexible handyman!

# *A* feet behind your head
It doesn't have to be your feet, really

# Who's then
Who could give you a leg?

# Someone who doesn't need it
The skeleton at the Viaduct doesn't need his leg anymore. Go grab his leg.

# It is mine
When you sit in the crane put the leg behind the seat.
