Final phase of the meditation is to take a sip from a flask.

# Doc has a flask
Yes, but he does not give you it. Maybe you could have your own bottle. You are a handyman after all.

# Bottle
Don't know if you noticed, but there was a bottle in the Outer Turn.

# It's empty
Fill it from Doc's flask

# He doesn't let me
If you could get him to a position and do it *sneakily*.

# Sneak
Talk to Doc and ask about meditation. When he is fixating with his leg behind his head just use the Empty Bottle to the Booze flask. Tada!

# Booze
Drink it only as the last step in the crane!
