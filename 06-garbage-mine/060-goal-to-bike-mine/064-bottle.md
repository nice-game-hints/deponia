Final phase of the meditation is to take a sip from a flask.

# Doc has a flask
Yes, but he does not give you it. Maybe you could have your own bottle. You are a handyman after all.

## Where do I find a bottle?
Don't know if you noticed, but there was a bottle at the Outer Turn.

# The bottle is empty
You should fill the bottle. ^[ You can fill the bottle from Doc's flask. ]

# Tell me how to fill the bottle
You can fill the bottle from Doc's flask. If you could get him to a certain position and fill the bottle *sneakily*.

## Tell me how to fill the bottle
Talk to Doc and ask about meditation. When he is fixating with his leg behind his head just use the Empty Bottle to the Booze flask. Tada!

# I now have booze in the flask
Drink it only as [the last step](index.md) in the crane!
