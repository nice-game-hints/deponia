If you have the crane working you still need the Bike Mine in to the Turn.

# Yes, how?
If you look closely the rails go so that you should get the [Mine Bike](/06-garbage-mine/040-mine-bike.md) to the tracks _in the back_.

# But how?
The Shunting Lever Box will move the Mine Bike to the other track.

# It is missing something
Yes, it is missing the lever.

# Lever
I think there was a lever in the Outer Turn (when you drive with the Mine Bike).

# Can't grab it
I think you have to walk there...

# It is so dark
Oh yeah, your bat signals don't work. [Can you shed some light there?](/06-garbage-mine/057-light-to-tunnel/index.md)

# It is lit
Go and grab the lever from the Outer Turn

# Shunting Lever
Attach the Lever to the Shunting Lever Box. Turn the Mine Bike to point to left (by driving it) and use the Lever. Drive the Mine Bike under the Funnel.
