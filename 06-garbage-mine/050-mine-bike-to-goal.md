If you have the crane working you still need to get the [mine bike](/06-garbage-mine/040-mine-bike.md) into the Turn.

# How do I get the bike to the turn?
If you look closely the rails go so that you should get the [mine bike](/06-garbage-mine/040-mine-bike.md) to the tracks _in the back_.

# How do I control the tracks?
The Shunting Lever Box will move the Mine Bike to the other track.

# The shunting lever box is missing something
Yes, it is missing the lever.

## Where do I find the lever?
I think there was a lever in the Outer Turn (when you drive with the Mine Bike).

# Rufus can't grab the lever
I think you have to walk there...

# The tunnel is too dark
Oh yeah, your bat signals don't work. [Shed some light into the tunnel?](/06-garbage-mine/057-light-to-tunnel/index.md)

# The tunnel is lit
Go and grab the lever from the Outer Turn.

# I have the shunting lever
Attach the Lever to the Shunting Lever Box. Turn the Mine Bike to point to left (by driving it) and use the Lever. Drive the Mine Bike under the Funnel.
