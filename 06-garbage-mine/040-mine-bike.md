Mine bike doesn't work. There is something missing from it.

# Pisto... plunge... what?
It is missing a pisto... er... plunge... you should be some kind of doctor to solve this!

## Doctor?
Yes, go and ask Doc! He is on the right, at the Viaduct.

## What should I do with Doc?
Did you talk to him about spare parts? You should also talk with him like a handyman to another. Talk with him about handymen and mine bikes. Voil√†, you got Avial Power Inventer!

# I have the Avial Power Inventer
Install it into the mine bike and off you go!

# Whoops!
It wasn't that hard, really! Go find the inventer from the Junk Heap!

# I found three inventers...
Yes, there are three power inverters. It is a skippable minigame to which you get hints from Doc. Ask help from him.

# I solved the minigame!
Great! You now have a working Avial Power Inverter. Go install it to the bike and get the lamp. The bike works now.
