Mine Bike doesn't work. There is something missing from it.

# Pisto... plunge... what?
It is missing a pisto... er... plunge... you should be some kind of doctor to solve this!

# Doc...
Hmm, yes. Go and ask Doc! He is on the right, at the Viaduct.

# Spare parts (and brain surgery)
Did you talk to him about spare parts? You should also talk with him like a handyman to another. Talk with him about handymen and mine bikes. Voil√†, you got Avial Power Inventor!

# I got it!
Now, install it to the bike and off you go!

# Whoops!
It wasn't that hard, really! Go find it from the Junk Heap!

# I found three...
Yes, there are three power inverters. It is a skippable minigame to which you get hints from Doc. Go talk to him.

# Solved!
You now have a working Avial Power Inverter. Go install it to the bike and get the lamp. The bike works now.
